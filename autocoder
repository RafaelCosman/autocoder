EXAMPLES
================

Code to write me a python file called example.py that prints out Hello World!:

# example.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello World!")

Code to Modify example.py to print it out 10 times:

# example.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for i in range(10):
        print("Hello World!")

Code to please comment example.py:

# example.py
# This file prints out "Hello World!" 10 times

if __name__ == "__main__": # Checks to see if the program is being run directly
    for i in range(10):
        print("Hello World!") # Prints "Hello World!" each time the loop is executed
